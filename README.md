# Streams in Node.js

## What is a Stream?

A stream is a way to handle continuous flow of data in small chunks, instead of loading everything into memory at once. Itâ€™s useful for working with large files or data sources.

## Types of Streams

Read Stream - Reads data from a source.
Write Stream - Writes data to a destination.  
Duplex Both - readable and writable (e.g., TCP socket).
Transform - Duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it passes through. |

## Why Do We Use Streams?

- Efficiently handle **large data** (no need to load everything into memory).
- **Asynchronous** and **non-blocking**.
- Works great for **real-time data** (e.g., video streaming, big files).

## Benefits of Using Streams

- **Memory-efficient:** Process data in small chunks.
- **Faster:** Start processing as soon as data is available.
- **Powerful:** Easily connect streams using pipe() for streamlined data flow.
- **Flexible:** Can handle various data sources (files, network, etc.).
